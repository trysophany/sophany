This is a versatile JavaScript date and time picker component with TypeScript support, compatible with any JavaScript frameworks and libraries. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and feature-rich, without relying on external dependencies.

## Key Features

-  **No Dependencies**: Completely self-contained, ensuring you don't need to include additional libraries.
- **Simple Localization**: Supports simple localization for any language.
- **Customizable**: Can be easily configured using CSS and HTML markup.
- **Multiple Instances**: Allows for an unlimited number of calendar instances on a single page.
- **Theme Support**: Supports automatic theme switching between light and dark modes, as well as custom user-defined themes.

- **Custom Weekends**: Define custom weekend days for each week as needed.

- **Not Tied to Input Tags**: Unlike many date pickers, it's not limited to the `<input>` tag.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install it using `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
npm install vanilla-calendar-pro
# or
yarn add vanilla-calendar-pro
```

### Usage

Here's a simple example of using it in your HTML:

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="calendar"></div>
    <!-- or -->
    <!-- <input type="text" id="calendar-input"> -->
  </body>
</html>
```

To add the necessary styles and scripts, you can use the following code:

```js
import { Calendar } from 'vanilla-calendar-pro';
import 'vanilla-calendar-pro/styles/index.css';

// Initialize the calendar
const calendar = new Calendar('#calendar');
calendar.init();
// or
// const calendarWithInput = new Calendar('#calendar-input', { inputMode: true });
// calendarWithInput.init();
```

## CSS Styles

```js
// Only layout calendar
import 'vanilla-calendar-pro/styles/layout.css';

// Themes
import 'vanilla-calendar-pro/styles/themes/light.css';
import 'vanilla-calendar-pro/styles/themes/dark.css';
// ...and others
```

The calendar can automatically switch between a light or dark theme depending on the user's system settings, or track a custom HTML attribute that specifies the desired theme.

- The `index.css` file contains all the styles from the `layout.css` file, as well as the light and dark theme styles.
- The `layout.css` file contains the essential structural styles for the calendar.
- The `themes/light.min.css` theme provides a light color scheme.
- The `themes/dark.min.css` theme offers a dark color scheme.
- ...and others

If you want to apply a specific theme, it is recommended to import `layout.css` along with your preferred theme instead of `index.css`.

## Layouts

VanillaCalendar features customizable DOM templates that allow you to modify the structure of the calendar to fit your needs. The templates are identified by tags containing the **#** character, and they should include a trailing slash at the end.

The calendar contains custom `layouts` for each calendar type, which allow you to change the calendar structure to suit your needs.
Each layout contains its own set of components that can be moved or removed from it if necessary. By default, a layout contains all the components available to it.
Components are identified by tags containing the `#` character, and they must contain a slash at the end of the tag.

Here is an example of the default layout:

```js
new Calendar('#calendar', {
  layouts: {
    default: `
      <div class="vc-header" data-vc="header" role="toolbar" aria-label="Calendar Navigation">
        <#ArrowPrev [month] />
        <div class="vc-header__content" data-vc-header="content">
          <#Month />
          <#Year />
        </div>
        <#ArrowNext [month] />
      </div>
      <div class="vc-wrapper" data-vc="wrapper">
        <#WeekNumbers />
        <div class="vc-content" data-vc="content">
          <#Week />
          <#Dates />
          <#DateRangeTooltip />
        </div>
      </div>
      <#ControlTime />
    `
  }
});
```
